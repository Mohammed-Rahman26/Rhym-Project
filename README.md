# Rhym-Project
I have done a group project in which we as a group needed to submit a project for threat actors and vulnerabilities in web scraped data of the sites. For this we have built an fully automated web scraping portal where it scrapes the data and stores the data dynamically and gives the threat actors and also the techniques to get rid of them.
